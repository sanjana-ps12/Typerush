This Typing Speed Tester is a web application designed to help users measure and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The application uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Key features of the application include:
* Quote-based Typing: The application presents a random quote for the user to type. The available quotes are: "Typing is a skill that improves with practice.", "Consistency is the key to mastering any skill.", "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.", "Practice makes perfect, especially in typing.", and "Speed and accuracy are both important in typing.".
* Real-time Statistics: As the user types, the website provides real-time updates on several metrics, including:
    * Time: The elapsed time in seconds since the user started typing.
    * Words: The number of words typed.
    * WPM (Words Per Minute): The calculated typing speed.
    * Errors: A count of the number of incorrect characters typed.
* Performance Feedback: The application provides a medal based on the user's performance:
    * Gold Medal: Awarded for a WPM of 50 or higher.
    * Silver Medal: Awarded for a WPM of 30 or higher.
    * Bronze Medal: Awarded for a WPM of 20 or higher.
    * If the user makes more than 5 errors, they receive a "❌ Too many errors!" message.
* User Interface: The site features a clean layout with a dedicated area for the quote, a text area for user input, and a statistics panel. It also includes a "Restart" button to load a new quote and try again.
* Theme Toggle: Users can switch between a light and a dark theme by clicking the "Toggle Theme" button.
* Confetti Animation: A celebratory confetti animation is triggered upon successful completion of a quote.
